# Helldivers Hellpad Simulator

This project simulates the Helldivers' Hellpad, perfect for practicing stratagem launches or for cosplay purposes.
I made this for using on a phone, integrated in Galactic Armory's Hellpad 3d prop.

## Features
- Full-screen interface with arrow buttons for input.
- Visual and audio feedback for correct and incorrect stratagem sequences.
- Includes most of the stratagems from Helldivers 2.
